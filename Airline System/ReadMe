Welcome to the AirLine Reservation System

This system has two types of user accounts, Passengers and Admins

Admin accounts can create and delete flights, and change the gate of already existing flights.
Flights created must depart and arrive on the same day. Admins can message users, they can also
message the flights that there are managing. Admins are flight managers for the flights that they
have created.

Passengers can reserve flights and cancel flight reservations. They can also message the flight managers of flights they
have reserved.

Admin accounts can be created by the main admin account. All types of accounts can be deleted by the main admin account aswell.
You can log into the main admin account using the username "admin_account" and password "password123".

To run the program, please run the main file.
